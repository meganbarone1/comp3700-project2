1. For customer screen, two use cases include adding a new customer and updating a current customer.
2. For product screen, two use cases include adding a new product and updating a current product.
3. For purchase screen, two use cases include adding a new purchase and updating a current purchase.




Screens for these would need:

Main screen:


  buttons saying "manage customer", "manage product", and "manage purchase"

  in each of those screens:
    fields for each
    load button and save button

    works by:

     putting an ID in the field box and pressing load would load the rest of the fields
     then changing those fields and pressing save would update the database

     putting a new ID in the field box as well as filling out other field boxes would add a new item to database
